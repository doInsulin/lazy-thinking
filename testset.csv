Test1,If you enter a building from the east side, walking west, and then take two rights and a left down corridors, which direction are you facing?,Step 1: Enter from east side, initial direction when walking is west (core logic: starting movement direction = west).||Step 2: First right turn from west: west → south (right turn rule: facing west, right = south).||Step 3: Second right turn from south: south → east (right turn rule: facing south, right = east).||Step 4: Left turn from east: east → north (left turn rule: facing east, left = north).||Final Answer: north
Test2,All bachelors have never married. John is a man who has never been married. Is John a bachelor?,Step 1: Define the core premise: All bachelors → have never married (universal statement: category "bachelor" is a subset of "people who never married").||Step 2: Analyze John's attributes: John is a man + has never been married (matches the necessary condition of the premise).||Step 3: Logical deduction: Since the premise states all bachelors have never married, and John meets the "never married" condition (key for the category), John is a bachelor.||Final Answer: Yes, John is a bachelor.
Test3,Prove that x² – 4x + 7 is positive for all values of x,Step 1: Use the method of completing the square for quadratic expression x² – 4x + 7.||Step 2: Rewrite x² – 4x as (x² – 4x + 4) – 4 (add and subtract (4/2)² = 4 to complete the square).||Step 3: Simplify the expression: (x – 2)² – 4 + 7 = (x – 2)² + 3.||Step 4: Analyze the squared term: (x – 2)² ≥ 0 for all real x (square of any real number is non-negative).||Step 5: Deduce the entire expression: (x – 2)² + 3 ≥ 0 + 3 = 3 > 0.||Final Conclusion: x² – 4x + 7 is positive for all values of x.
Test4,Triangular numbers are numbers that can make a triangular dot pattern. Prove that the n-th triangular number is Tₙ = n(n+1)/2. Also prove that 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³ = (1/4)n²(n+1)²,Step 1 (Prove Tₙ = n(n+1)/2): Triangular number Tₙ is the sum of first n positive integers: Tₙ = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.||Step 2: Write the sum in reverse: Tₙ = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1.||Step 3: Add the two equations: 2Tₙ = (1+n) + (2+(n-1)) + ... + (n+1) = n(n+1) (n pairs each summing to n+1).||Step 4: Divide by 2: Tₙ = n(n+1)/2 (proven).||Step 5 (Prove sum of cubes): Recall the identity that sum of first n cubes = (sum of first n integers)².||Step 6: Substitute sum of first n integers = Tₙ = n(n+1)/2.||Step 7: Square the sum: (n(n+1)/2)² = (1/4)n²(n+1)².||Final Conclusion: Both formulas are proven.
Test5,Jane won the lottery and decided to spend some of the money. She spent $1.50 on the first day. She spent $3 on the second day. She spent $4.50 on the third day. She kept spending her winnings in the same pattern and then on the last day, she spent her remaining $300. How much did she win in the lottery?,Step 1: Identify the spending pattern: Day 1=$1.50, Day 2=$3, Day 3=$4.50 → this is an arithmetic sequence with first term a₁=1.50 and common difference d=1.50.||Step 2: n-th term of arithmetic sequence: aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d = 1.50 + (n-1)*1.50 = 1.50n.||Step 3: Last day's spending = $300 = aₙ → 1.50n = 300 → n=300/1.50=200 days (total spending days).||Step 4: Sum of arithmetic sequence (total spending) = Sₙ = n(a₁ + aₙ)/2 = 200*(1.50 + 300)/2.||Step 5: Calculate total spending: 200*301.50/2 = 100*301.50 = $30150.||Step 6: Lottery winnings = total spending (since she spent all remaining money on the last day) = $30150.||Final Answer: Jane won $30150 in the lottery.
Test6,Given the following state capitols Montgomery, Juneau, Phoenix, Little Rock, Sacramento, what are the next five state capitols in the sequence? What are the last five state capitols in this sequence?,Step 1: Identify the sequence rule: The given capitols are in alphabetical order of their corresponding US states.||Step 2: List US states and capitols in alphabetical order: Alabama (Montgomery), Alaska (Juneau), Arizona (Phoenix), Arkansas (Little Rock), California (Sacramento) → matches the given sequence.||Step 3: Next five states (alphabetical) and capitols: Colorado (Denver), Connecticut (Hartford), Delaware (Dover), Florida (Tallahassee), Georgia (Atlanta).||Step 4: Last five US states (alphabetical) and capitols: Virginia (Richmond), Washington (Olympia), West Virginia (Charleston), Wisconsin (Madison), Wyoming (Cheyenne).||Final Answer: Next five capitols: Denver, Hartford, Dover, Tallahassee, Atlanta; Last five capitols: Richmond, Olympia, Charleston, Madison, Cheyenne.
Test7,Prove that 33ⁿ - 16ⁿ - 28ⁿ + 11ⁿ is divisible by 85 for all positive integers ≥ 2. Give me a step-by-step guide to this proof.,Step 1: Factor 85 into prime factors: 85 = 5 × 17 (coprime, so prove divisibility by 5 and 17 separately, then use Chinese Remainder Theorem).||Step 2: Prove divisibility by 5: Rewrite terms modulo 5: 33≡3, 16≡1, 28≡3, 11≡1 → expression ≡ 3ⁿ - 1ⁿ - 3ⁿ + 1ⁿ = 0 mod 5 (divisible by 5).||Step 3: Prove divisibility by 17: Rewrite terms modulo 17: 33≡16, 16≡16, 28≡11, 11≡11 → expression ≡16ⁿ -16ⁿ -11ⁿ +11ⁿ=0 mod17 (divisible by17).||Step 4: Alternative factorization (verify): Group terms: (33ⁿ - 28ⁿ) - (16ⁿ - 11ⁿ). Use aⁿ - bⁿ divisible by (a-b): 33-28=5, 16-11=5 → each group divisible by 5. Also, 33ⁿ -16ⁿ divisible by 17 (33-16=17), 28ⁿ -11ⁿ divisible by17 (28-11=17) → entire expression divisible by17.||Step 5: Since 5 and 17 are coprime, the expression is divisible by 5×17=85 for n≥2.||Final Conclusion: 33ⁿ -16ⁿ -28ⁿ +11ⁿ is divisible by 85 for all positive integers n≥2.
Test8,If I am driving, and hit on the brakes, would I a. feel a force pushing me forward b. not feel a force c. feel a force pushing me backwards,Step 1: Recall Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia): An object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced force.||Step 2: Driving scenario: You and the car are moving forward (same velocity). When brakes are hit, the car decelerates (force applied to car), but your body tends to keep moving forward (inertia).||Step 3: Perception of force: Your body moving forward relative to the slowing car creates the sensation of a "forward force" (actual: no new force, just inertia; but the question asks for what you feel).||Step 4: Evaluate options: a matches the perceived force, b and c are incorrect.||Final Answer: a. feel a force pushing me forward
